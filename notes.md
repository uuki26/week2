Problems I encountered for week 2 material

At first, I followed the instruction provided by the professor, and downloaded anaconda successfully. 
then I moved to the next step which is to open up 'terminal', however, I can't find the 'terminal' under ' application'
I messages professor and he helped me solved the problem which I need to hit command and space, and then typing 'terminal' 
Therefore, the first question solved!

Then I started to use the 'terminal' to run commands. I stuck with the first command which was typing conda--version. 
After I typed the command, it showed command not found. and I figured out that the format was wrong that I 
missed a space before'--'

Another problem I have was when I finished up creat the file 'url. txt' and then tried to pass the file to wget. I tried so many times and only received one result which is ' no such file or directory. 

So I changed another way to pass the file to wget. I type $ wget -i /Users/yuki/Documents/urls -r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k 

then I end up getting what I want successfully!

The notes and problems above are just the beginning of my digital learning journey. But as I was getting more practice and 
read the instruction again and again, I gradually familiar with some professional words such as 'terminal' 'command promote'.

One of the things I found is interesting was that I can download things on my machine just type a code on ' command promote'.
When I was doing the bonus part, I downloaded and installed youtube-dl to help me find different versions of the specific video on youtube. This function would help people to find the one video they need based on their preferences such as video qualities, or sizes. 

At the end, I feel like the python and digital language thing is super interesting. As a communication and media student, 
I never have a chance to take a class like this. And computer is part of our life, knowing the digital language is knowing the modern world.
