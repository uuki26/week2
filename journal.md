In my opinion, most of the users pay for the onilne working. For most of the software or social media online all required 
individuals to register an account which makes users become a part of the digital platform. This is a way that most of the digital
platfomrs make profit to send commercial centent to users.  Therefore, the interent users pay for online working.

I think programmers do most of the job running the website and keep the web and the system run stability. And they also have 
the responsibility to fix bugs and problems of the system. Besides, programmers encounter dissiculties as well, such as how to 
simplify the design of a structure, or how to make a software run more efficiently. Programmers are the most important role
to make the world go modernity, and their job greatly changed people's lifestyle. In a word, digital workers have create great 
value for the development of this world. 

It is important for programmers to protect users 'privacy and users' data. 
They are the person who designs the system so that it is easy for programmers to see users 'personal information 
such as banking information, personal address, browsing history. 
It would be easy for them to get users' preferences as well. 
Therefore, the ethical dimensions for programmers are to ensure personal data is safe and would not sell them for a third party.

Carleton does provide students with a resources to access material which is the 'library'. 
Students can find their interested article through the library. 
But the material of the Carleton library is not comprehensive, it is a normal thing to search an article through 'library' but end up getting a 'not found' result.  
One major barrier to the library is I clicked an article and try to open it, 
it required me to log in my institution account, but Carleton does not exist on their university list.
